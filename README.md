# galaxy-morphology-prediction
The main requirement to study the formation and evolution of galaxies is measuring the morphological parameters.
The traditional method to carry out morphological analysis is by visual inspection which is time consuming.
Only the trained experts can do the conventional way of analysis.
But in order to have an automated system which can give the
parameters directly using neural networks, we need a lot of
images to train the network. So the surveys like Sloan Digital
Survey (SDSS) made available a very large collection of images.
To classify those images, Galaxy Zoo project introduced the
crowdsourcing methodology. But still this method also didnâ€™t
reach the required level of accuracy. Here we present a deep
neural network model to classify the galaxies on the basis of
their morphology. This greatly reduces the experts workload
and gives the better accuracy.

This repository contains the code, a sample image from dataset and model file.
